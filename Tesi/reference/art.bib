   abstract = {Objective: After treatment with refractive correction and patching, some patients have residual amblyopia resulting from strabismus or anisometropia. We conducted a clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of increasing prescribed daily patching from 2 to 6 hours in children with stable residual amblyopia. Design: Prospective, randomized, multicenter clinical trial. Participants: A total of 169 children aged 3 to <8 years (mean, 5.9 years) with stable residual amblyopia (20/32-20/160) after 2 hours of daily patching for at least 12 weeks. Intervention: Random assignment to continue 2 hours of daily patching or increase patching time to an average of 6 hours/day. Main Outcome Measures: Best-corrected visual acuity (VA) in the amblyopic eye after 10 weeks. Results: Baseline VA was 0.44 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) (20/50-2). Ten weeks after randomization, amblyopic eye VA had improved an average of 1.2 lines in the 6-hour group and 0.5 line in the 2-hour group (difference in mean VA adjusted for acuity at randomization = 0.6 line; 95% confidence interval, 0.3-1.0; P = 0.002). Improvement of 2 or more lines occurred in 40% of participants patched for 6 hours versus 18% of those who continued to patch for 2 hours (P = 0.003). Conclusions: When amblyopic eye VA stops improving with 2 hours of daily patching, increasing the daily patching dosage to 6 hours results in more improvement in VA after 10 weeks compared with continuing 2 hours daily.

   abstract = {Citation: Chen Z, Li J, Thompson B, et al. The effect of Bangerter filters on binocular function in observers with amblyopia. Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. PURPOSE. We assessed whether partial occlusion of the nonamblyopic eye with Bangerter filters can immediately reduce suppression and promote binocular summation of contrast in observers with amblyopia. METHODS. In Experiment 1, suppression was measured for 22 observers (mean age, 20 years; range, 14-32 years; 10 females) with strabismic or anisometropic amblyopia and 10 controls using our previously established ''balance point'' protocol. Measurements were made at baseline and with 0.6-, 0.4-, and 0.2-strength Bangerter filters placed over the nonamblyopic/ dominant eye. In Experiment 2, psychophysical measurements of contrast sensitivity were made under binocular and monocular viewing conditions for 25 observers with anisometropic amblyopia (mean age, 17 years; range, 11-28 years; 14 females) and 22 controls (mean age, 24 years; range, 22-27; 12 female). Measurements were made at baseline, and with 0.4-and 0.2-strength Bangerter filters placed over the nonamblyopic/dominant eye. Binocular summation ratios (BSRs) were calculated at baseline and with Bangerter filters in place. RESULTS. Experiment 1: Bangerter filters reduced suppression in observers with amblyopia and induced suppression in controls (P ¼ 0.025). The 0.2-strength filter eliminated suppression in observers with amblyopia and this was not a visual acuity effect. Experiment 2: Bangerter filters were able to induce normal levels of binocular contrast summation in the group of observers with anisometropic amblyopia for a stimulus with a spatial frequency of 3 cycles per degree (cpd, P ¼ 0.006). The filters reduced binocular summation in controls. CONCLUSIONS. Bangerter filters can immediately reduce suppression and promote binocular summation for mid/low spatial frequencies in observers with amblyopia.},

   abstract = {Purpose: To assess the Pediatric Vision Scanner (PVS), a handheld vision screening device designed to test for amblyopia and strabismus, in a general pediatric population. Methods: In this prospective study, trained research staff screened 300 eligible children 24-72 months of age with no known eye conditions for amblyopia and strabismus using the PVS. A pediatric ophthalmologist masked to PVS screening results then performed a comprehensive eye examination. Sensitivity and specificity of the PVS was calculated with a 95% confidence interval. Results: Based on the gold standard eye examination, 6 children (2%) had amblyopia and/or strabismus. The PVS detected all 6 cases, yielding a sensitivity rate of 100% (95% CI, 54%-100%). The PVS referred 45 additional children (15%) who had normal ophthalmic findings, yielding a specificity rate of 85% (95% CI, 80%-89%). The median acquisition time for the PVS was 28 seconds. Conclusions: The PVS detected amblyopia with high sensitivity in a nonenriched pediatric population. The device would allow children with amblyopia and/or strabismus to be referred to an eye care specialist as early as 2 years old. Given its short acquisition time, the PVS can be implemented in a pediatric clinic with minimal impact on workflow.},
